# Data Analyst | Aspiring Data Scientist

I build data solutions and AI automation tools.

## Featured projects
### Football (Soccer) Prediction Model
Built a machine learning model that predicts soccer match results with high accuracy using feature engineering and Monte Carlo simulations. The model achieves an average error of less than 0.5 goals per match.
